# Don't use this version as the version you want.
If you want a platformer that uses a "terraria" style scrolling effect to allow worlds to be longer than the window allows. Go to [this link](https://github.com/JezzaR-The-Proto/Platformer/tree/new-scrolling)

If you prefer a platformer that is level-based. Go to [this link](https://github.com/JezzaR-The-Proto/Platformer/tree/new-level-based)
