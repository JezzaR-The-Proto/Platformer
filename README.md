# Pyglet-Platformer
 Platformer made in pyglet. WIP
## Why Pyglet?
 Pygame is the other (crap) alternative and it doesn't have vsync so i'm not using it.
## Requirements
 - Python 3.8.1
 - Pyglet and Shapely Libraries (pip install pyglet shapely)
## Installation
 Clone the Git Repo.
 
 Run the "Pyglet Platformer.py" or "Pyglet Platformer Dev.py" if you want the dev builds (usually broken).
